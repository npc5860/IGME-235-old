        <p>
            Dig Dug is a 1-2 player arcade game in which you have to use your <b>shovel</b> to dig your way through the
            earth.
            <br>
            Stopping you from doing this are two monsters, called <b>Pooka</b> and <b>Fygar</b>, who will continually
            chase you around.
            <br>
            The only weapon that you carry is an <b>air pump</b>, which you can use to <b>inflate</b> the monsters to
            the point where
            they <b>explode</b>. [...]
