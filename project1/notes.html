    <h2>Goals</h2>
    <p>
        I want to be able to show and describe the work I have done.<br>
        Attract and/or help get in to contact with employers
    </p>

    <h2>Audience</h2>
    <p>
        Mainly employers or people who are curious about what I've done.<br>
        Also me to keep track of what I have done and look back.
    </p>

    <h2>Content</h2>
    <p>
        Include any game jams I've done.<br>
        Big personal projects.<br>
        Team projects.<br>
        Note worthy academic projects.<br>
        <br>
        I think a card design would look nice. Each one having a picture, title and description
        of the project.<br>
        If someone wanted to know more about something they could click
        the card which would lead them to a page specifically about that project.
    </p>

    <h2>Notes</h2>
    <p>
        Make the project cards clickable.<br>
        Adjust spacing.<br>
        Choose color scheme.
    </p>
